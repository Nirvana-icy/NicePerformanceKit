## Introduction

DanmakuKit is a high performance library that provides the basic functions of danmaku. It provides a set of processes that allow you to generate the danmaku cell via cellModel, and each danmaku can be drawn either synchronously or asynchronously.

As shown in the GIF below, DanmakuKit offers three types of danmaku launch: floating, top and bottom.

### TODO

**If you have any requirements that you want DanmakuKit to provide, you can raise issue.**


## Example

For detailed usage, see the Example project, which provides a functional demonstration and an example of using it with a player. 

## Use Guide

1. Implement a model to inherit from the DanmakuCellModel. In this model you need to add your own properties and methods to draw the danmaku.
2. Implement a View inherited from DanmakuCell. Override the `willDisplay` method to prepare a thread-safe model for drawing a danmaku. Then you need to override the `displaying` method, and use CGContext draw your danmaku. **It is important to note when call `displaying` method was not in the main thread, so you need to consider multithreading.** And finally, if you also need to do something at the end of the drawing, you can override the `didDisplay` method to do that.
3. Pass the DanmakuCellModel to the DanmakuView so that it will fire the danmaku for you.

If you want to display GIF on a danmaku, then import the Gif subspec and use the DanmakuGifCell and DanmakuGifCellModel.
